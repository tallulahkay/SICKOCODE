## Kickoff Webinar Notes
- Dr. Sarah Eskreis-Winkler
- Dr. Bea Reig
- improve patient care
- make life better for breast cancer patients
- challenges the docs face:
    - it's uncomfortable to lie in scanner
        - less claustraphobic, less loud
        - scans are slow
    - potential to use AI to eliminate mundane tasks as radiologists
        - most mammograms are negative (a couple out of 1000 have cancer)
        - filter out or flag negatives
        - computers can see patterns
        - get rid of mundane tasks for docs
    - every step has possibility for tech improvement
        - ppl need to come in once per year (get more ppl to come in)
        - bringing prior mammograms is important
    - coregistration of images "is a nightmare": 2d projections in 2 orthogonal planes + ultrasound + mri
        - figure out how the different images correspond
        - connect points on different types of images
    - "walk through the journey of the patient" (add to clue??)
        - starting at age 40, every woman come in for mammogram annually (how can we reach that age?)
        - higher risk patients should come in more often
        - maybe a way younger people can take care of their older relatives?
        - risk assessment w/ a bunch of questions (question don't always capture everyone the right way) (how can we better assess people's risk, inform them, get them in the door)
    - prevention
        - not ready to risk-based screening
        - a lot of risk info that we aren't capturing
        - find out if ppl are at higher risk earlier and tell them to come in earlier/more often
        - height is a factor, personal history, family history
        - get messages out to women
    - identify barriers to screening!!
        - inconvenience, takes a while, might need multiple pictures or tests, how to keep them coming in?
            - smart scheduling to predict how long appointments will be/how many appointments necessary
        - socioeconomic issues maybe
        - childcare
        - transportation
    - customer satisfaction/communication
    - how to communicate with patients that have breast cancer
        - what are the patients going through?
        - NLP (natural language processing) could help communicate better (understand medical jargon - slurp?)
        - how to isolate patient's concern
            - fear of diagnosis vs. fear of procedure
        - trying to reach a doc's office can be frustrating
            - how to get a more personal touch from docs (in a SECURE way)
    - support communities, therapy
        - **wedding planning app** but for the breast cancer JOURNEY
            - including survivors
        - survivorship program (pair survivors w/ patients)
    - helping people know where to look for good information and resources
    - inter-doctor communication
    - information overload from doctors (how to get patients' or doctors' accurate and up-to-date info)
    - wikipedia for medical records ("living document")
    - "data overload" in both medical history and imaging
    - de-identify information for research
    - DATA
        - TCIA open database w/ images including breast cancer images
        - NIH has chest xray database
    - collaboration between docs
        - way to collab on same documents
    - Patient care
        - many different options an outcomes
        - hard to know what to expect from someone else's story

        - ppl without cancer that has horrible time while waiting to find out they don't have cancer

Bring breast cancer awareness/care to top of mind for every woman around the world as part of their daily routine. Offer tailored information to women based on their background.

Connect users to information
    Fancy UI: final product but doesn't work
        - demographic survey that lands you on an information hub
    Data/Research:
        - personas for many people w/ utereses to drive tailored content correllated with their "tech touchpoints"
        - ability to reach everyone by attaching product to existing platforms
    Tech Innovation:
        - input: who they are
        - output: customized care plan/resources



- Have a project skeleton pushed up that we can all contribute to
- Everyone has proper tools downloaded
- Have a meeting/work cadence scheduled (and on everyone's calendars) that we can all commit to
- Everyone walks away with a way to contribute
